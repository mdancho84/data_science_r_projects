Jennifer is 35% complete with the 101 course - and shows off her progress in this PDF Scraping tutorial. Jennifer has an interest in understanding the _plight of wildlife_ across the world, and uses her new data science skills to perform a useful analysis - ___scraping PDF tables of a Report on Endangered Species with the `tabulizer` R package and visualizing alarming trends with `ggplot2`___. 

# Scraping PDFs and Analyzing Endangered Species

<small>by Jennifer Cooper, Marketing Data Scientist at Skopos Financial</small>

I've been "heads down" this weekend working on a special R project. This week I gave myself a challenge to start using R at work and also come up with a project on the side that I could use to help review what I've learned so far in Business Science University's DS4B 101-R course (Link to ⭐️FREE⭐️ Jumpstart course:  https://bit.ly/2KALtJN).

In addition to being passionate about data science, I also love animals and am concerned about the plight of wildlife across the world, particularly with climate change. I decided to take a look at data on critically endangered species. 

The only thing I could find was in a __PDF format__, so I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the nuances of `tabulizer`. I finally got it done tonight!

Through this process, I discovered I still need a lot more practice, so I'm going to continue seeing what I can do to apply it at work (figured out how to connect to our SQL database this week), carve out more time to practice, and I may write up an article on working with `tabulizer` and PDFs.

# My Workflow

Here's a diagram of the workflow I used:

1. Start with PDF

2. Use `tabulizer` to extract tables

3. Clean up data into "tidy" format using `tidyverse` (mainly `dplyr`)

4. Visualize trends with `ggplot2`

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("Critically Endangered Species by Year.png")
```


# Get the PDF

I analyzed the [Critically Endangered Species PDF Report](https://github.com/Coopmeister/data_science_r_projects/blob/master/endangered_species.pdf). 




# PDF Scrape and Exploratory Analysis

## Step 1 - Load Libraries

Load the following libraries to follow along. 

```{r}
library(rJava)      # Needed for tabulizer
library(tabulizer)  # Handy tool for PDF Scraping
library(tidyverse)  # Core data manipulation and visualization libraries
```

Note that `tabulizer` depends on `rJava`, which may require some setup. Here are a few pointers: 

- __Mac Users:__ If you have isses connecting Java to R, you can try running `sudo R CMD javareconf` in the Terminal ([per this post](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/2254))

- __Windows Users:__ [This blog article](https://cimentadaj.github.io/blog/2018-05-25-installing-rjava-on-windows-10/installing-rjava-on-windows-10/) provides a step-by-step process for installing `rJava` on Windows machines. 



## Step 2 - Extracting the Tabular Data from PDF

The `tabulizer` package provides a suite of tools for extracting data from PDFs. The vignette, ["Introduction to tabulizer"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tabulizer/vignettes/tabulizer.html) has a great overview of `tabulizer`'s features. 

We'll use the `extract_tables()` function to pull out the tables from the Endangered Species Report. 


```{r}
endangered_species_scrape <- extract_tables("endangered_species.pdf", method = "decide", output = "data.frame")
```

The table I'm interested in is the first one - the Critically Endangered Species. I'll extract it using the `pluck()` function and convert it to a `tibble()` (the tidy data frame format). I see that I'm going to need to do a bit of cleanup.

```{r}
endangered_species_raw_tbl <- endangered_species_scrape %>% pluck(1) %>% as_tibble()

endangered_species_raw_tbl %>% head()
```

## Step 3 - Clean Up Column Names

Next, I want to start by cleaning up the names in my data - which are actually in the first row. I'll use a trick using `slice()` to grab the first row, and the new `pivot_longer()` function to transpose and extract the column names that are in row 1. I can then `set_names()` and remove row 1. 

```{r}
col_names <- endangered_species_raw_tbl %>%
    slice(1) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = everything()) %>%
    mutate(value = ifelse(is.na(value), "Missing", value)) %>%
    pull(value)

endangered_species_renamed_tbl <- endangered_species_raw_tbl %>%
    set_names(col_names) %>%
    slice(-1)

endangered_species_renamed_tbl %>% head()
```

## Step 4 - Tidy the Data

There are a few issues with the data:

1. Column labelled "Missing" is all NA's - We can just drop this column
2. 3 of the columns are combined - Amphibians, Fishes, and Insects - We can `separate()` these into 3 columns
3. The data is in "wide" format, which isn't tidy - We can use `pivot_longer()` to convert to "long" format with one observation for each row
4. The numeric data is stored as character and several of the numbers have commas - We'll remove commas and convert to numeric
5. The year and species columns are character - We can convert to factor for easier adjusting of the order in the ggplot2 visualizations
6. The visualizations will have a percent (proportion) included so we can see which species have the most endangered - We can add proportions by each year


```{r}
endangered_species_final_tbl <- endangered_species_renamed_tbl %>%
    
    # 1. Remove columns with NAs
    select_if(~ !all(is.na(.))) %>%
    
    # 2. Fix columns that were combined
    separate(col  = `Amphibians Fishes Insects`, 
             into = c("Amphibians", "Fishes", "Insects"), 
             sep  = " ") %>%
    
    # 3. Convert to (Tidy) Long Format for visualization
    pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = "species", values_to = "number") %>%
    
    # 4. Fix numeric data stored as character
    mutate(number = str_remove_all(number, ",")) %>%
    mutate(number = as.numeric(number)) %>%
    
    # 5. Convert Character Year & species to Factor
    mutate(Year = as_factor(Year)) %>%
    mutate(species = as.factor(species)) %>%
    
    # 6. Percents by year
    group_by(Year) %>%
    mutate(percent = number / sum(number)) %>%
    mutate(label = scales::percent(percent)) %>%
    ungroup()

endangered_species_final_tbl
```

## Step 5 - Visualize the Species

### Summary Visualization 

I made a summary visualization using stacked bar chart to show the alarming trends of critically endangered species over time. 

```{r, }
endangered_species_final_tbl %>%
    mutate(Year = fct_rev(Year)) %>%
    
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = number, fill = species)) +
    
    # Geoms
    geom_bar(position = position_stack(), stat = "identity", width = .7) +
    geom_text(aes(label = label), position = position_stack(vjust= 0.5), size = 2) +
    coord_flip() +
    
    # Theme
    labs(
        title = "Critically Endangered Species",
        y = "Number of Species Added to Critically Endangered List", x = "Year"
    ) +
    #scale_fill_brewer() +
    #scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_minimal()
```

### Trends Over Time by Species

I then faceted the species and visualized the trend over time using a smoother (`geom_smooth`). Again, we see that each of the species exhibit increasing trends.

```{r, fig.height=8}
endangered_species_final_tbl %>%
    mutate(Year = fct_rev(Year)) %>%
    
    ggplot(aes(Year, number, color = species, group = species)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
    facet_wrap(~ species, scales = "free_y", ncol = 3) +
    
    # Theme
    expand_limits(y = 0) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    labs(
        title = "Critically Endangered Species",
        subtitle = "Trends Not Improving",
        x = "", y = "Changes in Number of Species in Threatened Category"
    )
    
```
